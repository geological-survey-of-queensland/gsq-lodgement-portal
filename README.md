# GSQ Lodgement Portal

## Purpose of this document

Provide a specification for the new GSQ Lodgement Portal that:  
* Accurately defines the business requirements
* Is a key input to software design for a software developer  

The primary input into this document is the data model defined in the [Resources Industry Report Profile](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/industry-report-profile).

## Background

Resource authority holders need to submit a range of statutory reports on their activities. Reports include all mineral exploration, geothermal exploration, greenhouse gas exploration, petroleum exploration, petroleum well, seismic survey or airborne geophysical survey, mineral development licence, petroleum lease, and petroleum pipeline licence reports and some other exploration related reporting.

When government issues a permit to a holder, the legislation requires a permit holder to submit reports to the Department when certain activities are performed under the conditions of the permit.  
* The reports contain knowledge of the geological resource. 
* Historically, industry reports have been lodged through [QDEX Reports](https://qdexguest.dnrm.qld.gov.au/portal/site/qdex/search).  
* GDMP will deliver a new lodgement portal to replace QDEX Reports.  
* Most industry reports have a confidentiality period before becoming open file.  

## The Lodgement Portal

### Objectives of the Lodgement Portal

1. Provide a single portal for industry and GSQ to lodge georesources reports.
2. Provide data validation at point of data entry.
3. Provide a database store to store in-progress and submitted reports.
4. Harvest the submitted metadata, data and datasets for insertion into CKAN, S3 and the [GeoProperties Database](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/ssor-database).
5. Provide search functionality for GSQ staff to search for reports.
6. Replace QDEX Reports.

### Vendor deliverables

1. An online lodgement portal to allow industry users to submit reports and upload associated geoscience data files in a structured, itemised format.  
    a.Data must be able to be submitted through a human-computer interface  
    b.Data must be able to be submitted through a computer-computer interface  
2. Automated workflows to process the geoscience data submitted to the geological properties database, and data catalogue and data object store.
3. A method of enabling the upload of large geoscience data files to the data object store.

## Four versions of the Lodgement Portal

There are 4 versions of lodgement portal to be built:

1. MVP Lodgement Portal to replace the current lodgement functionality of QDEX reports - described on this page.
2. Version 2 Lodgement Portal that extends the MVP Lodgement Portal to parse the data lodged in the petroleum, coal, and mineral reporting guideline templates - described on [Version2-portal-README.MD](/Version2-portal-README.MD)
3. Multipart lodgement form (per ModulrTech style) for mineral & coal annual report - described on [Version3-portal-README.MD](/Version3-portal-README.MD)
4. Multipart lodgement form (per ModulrTech style) for well completion report - described on [Version4-portal-README.MD](/Version4-portal-README.MD)

## Iterative delivery of the versions

It is vital that GSQ exit QDEX Reports by June 30, 2020. Hence, we will iterate through the 4 versions:

1. Analyse, design, build, and deploy Version 1 - the MVP Lodgement Portal. This portal replaces QDEX Reports.  
  a. The MVP software (Version 1) provides the platform and "plumbing" for all future versions - i.e. web portal, authentication, authorisation, lodgement form, lodgement database, metadata, CKAN integration, S3 integration, spatial processing.  
  b. The MVP software enables data migration out of QDEX Reports into the Lodgement Portal.  
  c. The MVP software enables data migration out of QDEX Reports into the Data Catalogue (Open Data Portal, Private Data Portal, and Data Object Store (S3)).  
2. Analyse, design, build, and deploy Version 2 - inheriting the functionality of the MVP and building the parsing functionality to populate the Geoproperties database.
3. Analyse, design, build, and deploy Versions 3 and 4.

## Lodgement Form PID minting

The Persistent Identifier (PID) is the unique identifier for a site or survey that is submitted to the department. GSQ needs industry to use this PID when submitting data to the department.

### Minting a new PID

Customers lodge _Notice of Intention_ forms to the department. This means that the borehole or the survey is proposed but not completed.

We need to tell the submitter of the form what the PID is and what it is used for. We can do this by emailing the PID to the submitter after successful submission. We want to do this after the form submission so we don't get orphan PIDs, i.e. PIDs created without the accompanying lodgement metadata.

Figure 2: Lodgement Portal PID minting</p>

### Matching an existing PID

When the submitter submits a _Notice of completion (or abandonment, etc.)_ form, we need to tie this lodgement to the _proposed_ borehole or survey record in the GSQ database.

For instance:

* A customer earlier submitted a [PA-21A - Notice of intention to carry out seismic survey or scientific or technical survey](https://www.dnrme.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/259897/pa-21a-notice-intention-survey.pdf)
* The system gave them the PID of the Survey, e.g. SS36789
* Now the customer lodges a [PA-22A - Notice of completion of seismic survey or scientific or technical survey](https://www.dnrme.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/259898/pa-22a-notice-completion-survey.pdf)
* The customer enters the PID of the Survey SS36789 so we can tie the _completion notice_ to the _intention notice_, i.e. tie to the completed survey to the proposed survey.
* The _status_ of the Survey can now be changed to _completed_.
* When the customer later lodges a _Seismic Survey Report - Final_, again they enter the PID so that the report is tied to Survey SS36789.

## Report "collections" that will be migrated to the Lodgement Portal vs Reports that will be migrated into the Open Data Portal

The following data is to be migrated from QDEX Reports. Historically, QDEX Reports has been used to publish other types of publications.

* The new lodgement portal will focus on reports lodged by industry (Exploration Reports and Industry Consultative Reports).
* Other types of publications will be published directly through the Open Data Portal - i.e. GSQ staff will use the CKAN Open Data Portal to publish, not lodge them through the Lodgement Portal.

|Name|Description|QDEX Count|Migrate metadata to|Migrate data objects to|
